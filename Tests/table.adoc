.Table with a title, three columns, a header, and two rows of content

<1> Unless the `cols` attribute is specified, the number of columns is equal to the number of vertical bars on the first non-blank line inside the block delimiters.
<2> When a blank line follows a single line of column titles, the column titles row will be styled as a header row by default.

.Table with two columns, a header, and two rows of content
<1> The `*` in the `cols` attribute is the repeat operator. It means repeat the column specification for the remainder of columns. In this case, it means to repeat the default formatting across 4 columns. When the header row is not defined on a single line, you must use the `cols` attribute to set the number of columns and `options` attributes to make the first row a header.

[cols="2*", options="header"]

|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2

.Table with three columns, a header, and two rows of content
