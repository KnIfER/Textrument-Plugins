### Merged Commit 1 : Bring back DirectX animation.  
> Another cool effect that can be easily added is the ability to do 3D rendering directly on the canvas. Just throw in some DirectX calls and you'll be able to write cool page transitions, highlight a control with some cool sparkling particle-effect or just put some glow effect on the edit-box with focus.

Thanks to clrhcp, you can now define DX animations directly in the XML.
